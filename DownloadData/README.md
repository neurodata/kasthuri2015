# ~~Data Access~~
~~These scripts are written to work with 2.7 and (ideally, but untestedly) Python 3. A script to download the [*CELL*, Kasthuri (July 30 2015)](http://www.openconnectomeproject.org/#!kasthuri11/c12r2) data) is included, named `download_data.py`.~~

~~In order to set up the python environment, you'll need to download a few libraries. You can use `pip` for this, and run `pip install -r requirements` from inside this directory, or you can manually install each of the libraries listed in the `requirements` file.~~

~~**To install the necessary OCP packages**, you can run the `get_ocp_packages.sh` bash script in this directory. Otherwise, you can download them manually: You'll need the [ocpaccess](https://github.com/openconnectome/ocpAccess) package which handles the download and conversion of data from OCP servers.~~
